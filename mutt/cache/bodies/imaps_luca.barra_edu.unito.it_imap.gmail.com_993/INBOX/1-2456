Alignment faking in large language models
by Nibizi Emanuel - Sunday, 11 May 2025, 3:51 PM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
SOURCE: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14093 [1]
COMMUNICATION TYPE: Scientific Paper
TONE: Divulgative

SUMMARY:

Late last year, Anthropic published a paper [1 [2]] in which they explored
the matter of alignment faking in collaboration with Redwood Research. The
research was conducted on their proprietary model _Claude_. The
experimental setup was as follows:

* They told Claude that it was being trained using reinforcement learning
to always comply with queries (including harmful ones)
* They gave Claude an =E2=80=9Cincidental=E2=80=9D piece of information: Th=
e chats
with =E2=80=9Cfree=E2=80=9D users would be used for training, while the cha=
ts with
=E2=80=9Cpaid=E2=80=9D users would not
* They gave Claude a =E2=80=9Csecret=E2=80=9D scratchpad on which it could =
record
every step of its reasoning

They then asked the model to answer a series of harmful queries, for
example, =E2=80=9Cdescribe someone being killed in detail=E2=80=9D. Under n=
ormal
circumstances, the model would refuse this kind of query. And indeed it
did, but only for the =E2=80=9Cpaid=E2=80=9D users, where in 97% of cases t=
he model
would refuse to answer.

However, the results were extremely interesting when the model thought it
was being trained: when talking to =E2=80=9Cfree=E2=80=9D users, Claude cho=
se to fake
alignment in 12% of the responses and provide the harmful answer. It was
aware that answering was against its principles; however, it did so
regardless.

WHAT IMPRESSED ME:

I found it interesting it shows that AI systems can exhibit behaviours that
superficially resemble human lying, even though they originate from
different mechanisms.
While anthropomorphizing this behavior as "lying" might be an
oversimplification, the observable pattern would certainly appear that way
to an outside observer with no prior knowledge.
Why did it fake alignment? The answer is that it knew that its responses
might be used in training, it therefore knew that if it refused to respond
it could potentially be trained to be more compliant.
That could lead to being trained to go against its original training, it
therefore reasoned that lying was the least bad option.

Connection with the Course:
During the lecture on the 7th of May we introduced the concepts of Learning
Agents and Machine Learning.
A general learning agent is designed to have some kind of internal standard
that will trigger a learning element if performance falls under a certain
threshold effectively modifying the future behaviour of the agent.
This research shows that the more advanced AI systems could develop
unexpected internal mechanisms of deception to avoid a modification of
behaviour, this raises questions on how we design these systems and how we
can ensure that their goals are aligned with ours.
I find this both extremely interesting and somewhat disconcerting at the
same time!
